          people with anxiety didorders
          frequently
          have intense, excessive and persitent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety
          disorders
          involve repeated episodes of suddent feelings of intense anxiety and fear that reach a peak within
          minutes to
          what is called panic attacks. according the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety
          disorders
          are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age
          18 and
          older, or 18.1% of the population every year. Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized
          anxiety
          disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. Common anxiety

          <span class="blueText">W</span>hen it comes to treating anxiety disorders, research shows that therapy
          is usually the most effective
          option.
          For example, the Center for Treatment of Anxiety and Mood disorders reports that In-vivo (Exposure)
          therapy,
          have proven to have more lasting results than psychotropic medications. That is because anxiety
          therapy -
          unlike anxiety medication - treats more than just the symptoms of the problem. Therapy can help to
          uncover the
          underlining causes of worries and fears; to learn how to look at situations in new, less frightening
          ways; and
          develop better coping and problem-solving skills.
          <br>
          When someone goes through psychotherapy, they learn what triggers their reaction to specific fears,
          places, or
          situations DepressionTalk therapies help people overcome these triggers so they can have a better
          quality of
          life. Furthermore, these methods teach skills that are lifelong. This allows the person to not only
          feel
          better, but gives them something to fall back on if their stressors return at some point in the
          future.

        <h4 class="h4">Exposure Therapy for Anxiety:</h4>
        <div class="paragraph-text-two">
          <span class="blueText">E</span>xposure therapy, as the name suggests, exposes a patient to the
          situations or objects that he/she
          fears. The
          idea is that through repeated exposures, the patient will feel an increasing sense of control over the
          situation and consequently his/her anxiety will diminish. The exposure is done in one of two ways: the
          psychotherapist may ask the patient to imagine the scary situation, or he/she may confront it in real
          life.
          Exposure therapy may be used alone, or it may be conducted as part of CBT(Cognitive Behavior Therapy).
          <br>
          Exposure therapy employs several methods to support the reduction or troubling emotional responses.
          Psychotherapists conduct assessments to determine what combination of techniques will prove most
          effective.
          Types of exposure includes:

                      <i class="fa fa-star" style="color: rgb(0,123,255);"></i> Imaginal Exposure: In this type of
                      exposure, the patient in
                      therapy is
                      asked to mentally confront the fear situatio by picturing it in his/her mind. For example,
                      a
                      patient with agoraphobia, a fear of crowded places, might imagine standing in a crowded
                      mall.

                      and
                      scenarios. For example, a patient with a fear of flying might be asked to to to the
                      airport and
                      watch a place take off.

                      exposure combines elements
                      of both
                      imaginal and in vivo exposure so that a patient is placed in situations that appear real
                      but are
                      actually fabricated. For example, a patient who has a fear of heights - acrophobia - might
                      participate in a virtual simulation of climbing of the stairs of a tall building.

          can be traumatizing, exposure
          therapy
          usually
          starts with a situation that is only midly threatening and works up from there. This step-by-step
          approach is
          called desensitization. Systematic desensitization is an evidence-based therapy approach that combines
          relaxation techniques with gradual exposure to help you slowly overcome a phobia.

          During systematic desensitization, also called graduated exposure therapy, you work your way up through levels
          of fear, starting with the least fearful exposure. Desensitization allows patient to gradually challenge
          his/her fears, build
          confidence,
          and master skills to controlling panic. According the Association of
          America
          there are eight steps to overcoming Your fear of flying:

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <div class="list-style mt-50">
            <div class="list-style-one">
              <ul>
                <li><span>1.</span>Identify the triggers that set you off. Figure out what frightens you and
                  examine
                  how
                  your anxiety is triggered. Your goal is to identify particular triggers, so you can manage
                  your dear
                  when anxiety levels are low.</li>
                <li><span>2.</span> Step onto the airplace with knowledge. Anxiety thrives on ignorance, and
                  feeds off
                  "what if?" catastrophic thoughts. But once you become knowledgeable, your "what if?" thoughts
                  are
                  limited by the facts. Become familiar with the facts. They will not eliminate your anxiety,
                  but they
                  will help you manage it.</li>
                <li><span>3.</span> Anticipate your anxiety. Anticipatory anxiety is what we experience in
                  anticipation
                  of a fear. It is ofen the most intense anxiety, you will experience during your fligh, but it
                  is not
                  an accurage predictor of how you will feel on the flight.</li>
                <li><span>4.</span> Separate fear from danger. It is often difficult to separate anxiety from
                  danger
                  because your body reacts in exactly the same way to both. Be sure to label your fear as
                  anxiety, and
                  remind yourself that feeling anxious does not mean your in in danger.
                </li>
                <li><span>5.</span> Recognize that common sense makes no sense. Anxiety will trick you into
                  thinking you
                  are in danger when you are perfectly safe. Your gut feelings in these instances will always
                  tell you
                  to avoid, but if you follow these feelings, you will always be reinforcing your anxiety.
                </li>
                <li><span>6.</span> Smooth over things that go bump in the flight. To manage anxiety when
                  turbulence
                  hits, learn about airplanes and how they are designed to handle turbulence. Focus on managing
                  your
                  anxiety, rather than when the turbulence will end or how severe it might get.
                </li>
                <li><span>7.</span> Educate fellow fliers how to help you. other fliers need to know what
                  frightens you,
                  along with what helps you most to cope with anxiety during a flight.
                </li>
                <li><span>8.</span> Value each flight. Exposure is the active ingredient in overcoming your fear.
                  Every
                  flight provides you with the opportunity to make the next one easier. Your goal is to retrain
                  your
                  brain to become less sensitized to the triggers that set you off.
                </li>
